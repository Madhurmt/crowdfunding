# 💰 DecentraFund - A Minimal Crowdfunding Smart Contract

## 📖 Project Description
DecentraFund is a decentralized crowdfunding platform built on Ethereum using Solidity.  
It allows anyone to create a transparent fundraising campaign where contributors can send ETH to support a cause or project.  
If the funding goal is reached by the campaign deadline, the funds are released to the project owner.  
Otherwise, contributors can reclaim their funds.

## 🌍 Project Vision
The vision of DecentraFund is to **empower creators and innovators** by removing intermediaries and ensuring **trustless fundraising** through blockchain transparency.  
Our mission is to make crowdfunding **accessible, secure, and verifiable** for everyone.

## 🔑 Key Features
- **Simple & Transparent:** Only 3 core functions for easy use and auditability.  
- **Automatic Refunds:** Contributors can reclaim funds if the campaign fails to reach its goal.  
- **Decentralized Ownership:** Smart contract logic ensures that only the campaign owner can withdraw funds when conditions are met.

## 🚀 Future Scope
- **Multi-Campaign Support:** Allow creation of multiple campaigns in a single contract.  
- **Milestone-Based Funding:** Gradual fund release as project goals are achieved.  
- **Token Rewards:** Issue reward tokens to backers for their support.  
- **Integration with Frontend DApp:** Build a user-friendly React or Next.js interface for interaction.  
- **Support for Stablecoins:** Enable contributions in USDC, DAI, or other ERC-20 tokens.
